## 🛠️ Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- npm or yarn
- Git
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- MetaMask browser extension (for wallet connection)

### Installation

```bash
# Install smart contract dependencies
npm install

# For backend (prebuilt - configure and run)
cd backend && npm install

# For frontend (prebuilt - configure and run)
cd frontend && npm install
```

**Note:** Both the backend and frontend apps are prebuilt. You need to configure them, not build them from scratch.
